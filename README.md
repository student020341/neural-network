A simple neural network project

- [x] simplify project structure
- [x] import pieces of canvas base project for rendering foundation
- [ ] create simple and well documented organism(s?)
- [x] create github or surge page for repo

A demonstration is live at https://student020341.github.io/neural-network/

View main.js for an organization of the data (declarations, render functions, etc) and check out hopper.js or fish.js for the drawing and logic of each creature
